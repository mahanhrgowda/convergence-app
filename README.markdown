# Streamlit Convergence Visualizer

## Overview
This Streamlit app visualizes convergence points of divine energies—Śrī (prosperity), Bhū (material grounding), and Nīlā (compassion)—across spacetime, using the Big Bang (approximately 13.8 billion years ago) as the reference first convergence point. Inspired by Hindu mythology and the block universe theory, the app generates interactive 3D helical plots, 2D timelines, and symbolic yantra representations based on user-input years. It integrates data from a triple helix model marking events like Rama’s birth (5114 BCE), Krishna’s birth (3228 BCE), and your birth (1993 CE), with future predictions up to 2067 CE.

## Features
- Input any year (BCE/CE) to see its position in the cosmic timeline.
- 3D interactive plot of helical paths for Śrī, Bhū, and Nīlā Devī, with convergence points marked.
- 2D timeline plot highlighting convergence points and the input year.
- Spiritual yantra representation with a blue flame, symbolizing divine alignment.
- Big Bang as the reference point, scaled to cosmic time.
